<h1>My Credetials</h1>

<p>I earned my Master of Education in  Education Technology Adult Learning and Training Emphasis, with Distinction. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Marketing.</p>

<p>As a lifelong learner that is devotion to 21st century classroom dynamics, my instructional academic disciplines include: Business Education, Computer Science and Spanish as a world language. Prior to becoming an educator I worked in the business field for 20 years and gained valuable knowledge that I integrate into my classroom.</p>  

<p>Working at JP Morgan Chase as an Account Executive and Closer in Sales/Marketing, has provided me with business experience and nurtured valuable business strategies and skills. Some of these skills include, analytical, communication, problem solving and presentation skills.  It also provided me with the opportunity to learn to review legal documentation, title work and conduct confidentiality with sensitive documents which has led me to be committed to excellence.  I promote an ethical work environment independently and within a team.</p>

<p>While working at Oce/Canon Financial as a portfolio manager for the Private and Public sector, I learned to analyze data and discover financial invoicing errors on a workbook that included multiple spreadsheets with massive data that surpassed a $ 2 million dollar portfolio.  Update payment information which was then transferred to the accounting department for input.  I had the opportunity to collaborate within a team and present to upper management solutions to problems that arose or were about to arise to due overpayment or misapplication of funds within the account or to another account. I was able to use the VLOOKUP function to simplify data analysis and data entry logs.</p>
